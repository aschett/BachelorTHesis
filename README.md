# BachelorThesis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for my bachelor thesis project, which focuses on fine-tuning machine learning models to predict the memorability of text. The project involves preprocessing data, training and fine-tuning models, and evaluating their performance. The scripts are provided as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project can be found and downloaded [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/memorability.html).
